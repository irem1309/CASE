whenever you enqueue a new SyncJob, it will attempt to sync the data for the specified user. If any errors occur during the process, it will retry the job up to 3 times before finally logging the error and moving on. The log messages provide detailed information about the sync process, which can be helpful for debugging and monitoring purposes.
